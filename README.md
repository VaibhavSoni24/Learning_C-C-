C/C++ Learning Journey Repository

Welcome to the repository documenting my learning journey in C/C++ programming. This collection showcases the projects, assignments, and exercises Iâ€™ve completed as I dive deeper into the world of C and C++. Throughout this journey, I aim to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts and develop problem-solving skills using these powerful languages.

Key Highlights:
Core Concepts: Understanding and implementing foundational concepts like variables, data types, operators, loops, and conditionals in both C and C++.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Gaining hands-on experience with C++ features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Data Structures & Algorithms: Implementing common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues) and algorithms (sorting, searching) in C/C++ to build efficient solutions.
Memory Management: Mastering the use of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and memory management techniques that are central to C/C++ programming.
Projects & Exercises: A variety of mini-projects and coding exercises that test my understanding of these languages and enhance my problem-solving abilities.
Learning Insights: Continuous documentation of key takeaways, challenges faced, and solutions found during my learning process.
Purpose:
This repository not only highlights my progress in C/C++ programming but also serves as a resource for reinforcing my skills, tracking growth, and referencing important concepts. Whether you're starting your journey in C/C++ or looking for coding examples, feel free to explore, suggest improvements, and collaborate.
